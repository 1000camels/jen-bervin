A relatively minimalist show at first glance, the development and installation of the *Silk Poems* exhibition took the better part of two years. Museum staff were kept busy sourcing the microscope and projectors, converting the opening gallery wall into an exhibition element, choosing silk textiles from UMAG’s permanent collection, translating and subtitling Charlotte Lagarde’s film, creating a movie of bilingual selections from the book *Silk Poems*, and developing a range of programming for events scheduled around Hong Kong.
