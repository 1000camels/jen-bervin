A relatively minimalist show at first glance, the development and installation of the *Silk Poems* exhibition took the better part of two years. Museum staff were kept busy sourcing the microscope and projectors, converting the opening gallery wall into an exhibition element, choosing silk textiles from UMAG’s permanent collection, translating and subtitling Charlotte Lagarde’s film, creating a movie of bilingual selections from the book *Silk Poems*, and developing a range of programming for events scheduled around Hong Kong.

Ms Bervin and Lagarde couriered most of the exhibition items with them from their home studio in Connecticut, arriving a few days before the scheduled opening.

The morning after completing the installation, HKU's campus was locked down when a segment of the social protest movement shifted focus, barricading the university’s entrances and blocking the main road in front of the Museum. During the span of Bervin's exhibition period, entrance to UMAG was also interrupted by the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors were instrumental in the Museum speeding up the timeline for launching several digital initiatives as a way to keep our doors 'open' to Hong Kong and global audiences.
