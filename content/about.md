*Silk Poems* is the first volume in UMAG's Digital Chapbook series. The publication was designed by Darcy Christ using [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/), the Getty's open-source platform. Quire is a multi-format publishing tool that can be used to create traditional and enhanced books from a single set of plain-text files.

UMAG gratefully acknowledges the generous support of the U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong and Macau for funding the Silk Poems exhibition at UMAG and in this digital format. Further thanks are due to the IPNHK festival for helping to sponsor and host Jen Bervin and Charlotte Lagarde.
