*Silk Poems* began as a six-year research project developed with expertise from more than thirty international textile archives, medical libraries, nanotechnology and biomedical labs, and sericulture sites. Jen Bervin first visited the Bioengineering Department at Tufts in 2010, where David Kaplan and Fiorenzo Omenetto were working on a new form of the material—reverse-engineered liquefied silk. Among the research outputs from the Tufts group has been a silk biosensor etched nanoscale on clear silk film that can be implanted in the body to provide diagnostic readings.

Using this research as a springboard, Bervin started to write a poem to be inscribed on a silk biosensor. The poem acts as a talisman, written from the perspective of the silkworm, addressed to the person with the biosensor implanted in their body. From this evolved the first few elements of the *Silk Poems* project—an etched version of the poem viewed through a microscope, Charlotte Lagarde’s short film and book published by Nightboat Books.

The inaugural display of work related to Bervin’s *Silk Poems* was as part of a group show at [MASS MoCA](https://massmoca.org/event/explode-every-day-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomena-of-wonder/?id=1045) (May 2016–April 2017). The solo exhibition of *Silk Poems* at [UMAG](https://www.umag.hku.hk/en/exhibition_detail.php?id=1642023) (November 2019–February 2020) was staged as part of the 10th anniversary celebration of the [IPNHK](https://ipnhk.org/) literary festival.
