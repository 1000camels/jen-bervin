#### [Jen Bervin](http://jenbervin.com/)
Created in collaboration with artists and specialists ranging from material scientists to literary scholars, Bervin’s intricate, intimate, often laborious work ranges in scale from poems written nanoscale in liquefied silk to large-scale museum installations. Her multidisciplinary, research-driven practice activates the intersections of text and textiles, art, poetry, and scholarship, science, technology and craft.

Bervin’s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at The University of Hong Kong, Des Moines Art Center, and Brown University; an upcoming survey exhibition of her interdisciplinary work at University Galleries of Illinois State University is supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Bervin’s work has been featured at the Walker Art Center, MASS MoCA, John Michael Kohler Art Center, Center for Craft, Creativity and Design, The Power Plant, Toronto, Ian Potter Museum of Art, Melbourne, and can be found in thirty international collections including The J. Paul Getty Museum.

Her multidisciplinary, research-driven practice activates the intersections of text and textiles, art, poetry, scholarship, technology and craft.
