The first iteration of the *Silk Poems* show at Mass MoCA included three elements—the nanoimprinted poem viewed through a microscope, a copy of the *Silk Poems* book and Charlotte Lagarde’s film. For the UMAG exhibition, we expanded the show’s initial framework by adding material produced for the Poetry Nights festival, as well as material that was generated while developing the original project with researchers at Tufts University.

When first entering the Fung Ping Shan gallery, visitors were greeted by a projection of bilingual selections from the book and a silkscreened strand of the poem which was made during a Rauschenberg Residency. Due to the HKU campus shut down, the official opening for the exhibition was combined with Ms Bervin’s Poetry Nights reading at the Jao Tsung-I Academy in Kowloon. Over the week of the festival, many of the festival participants took part in guided tours of the exhibition.

A number of related public events were developed for the exhibition space. One of the most popular was a series of weekend drawing courses led by artist Philippe Charmes. Participants worked from specimens on loan from a collection managed by Dr Benoit Guénard in the HKU School of Biological Sciences.
