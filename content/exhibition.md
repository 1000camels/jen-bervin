Ms Bervin and Lagarde couriered most of the exhibition items with them from their home studio in Connecticut, arriving a few days before the scheduled opening.

The morning after completing the installation, The University of Hong Kong was locked down. A segment of the protest movement had shifted focus to HKU, barricading the university’s entrances and blocking the main road in front of the Museum. Elsewhere in Hong Kong, approximately 100 protesters remained barricaded inside Polytechnic University (PolyU) for the fourth consecutive day.

The original iteration of the *Silk Poems* show at Mass MoCA included three elements—the nanoimprinted poem viewed through a microscope, a copy of the *Silk Poems* book and Charlotte Lagarde’s film. For the UMAG exhibition, we expanded the original show by adding a projection of bilingual selections from the book, a vitrine highlighting Granary Press’ special edition of *Silk Poems*, a second vitrine with reference materials and notes about the development of the exhibition, a silk textile produced during Ms Bervin’s Rauschenberg Residency, and four silk textiles from the UMAG collection. The curation of the silk textiles was carried out by UMAG researcher Kikki Lam.
