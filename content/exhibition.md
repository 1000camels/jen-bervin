The original iteration of the *Silk Poems* show at Mass MoCA included three elements—the nanoimprinted poem viewed through a microscope, a copy of the *Silk Poems* book and Charlotte Lagarde’s film. For the UMAG exhibition, we expanded the original show by adding a projection of bilingual selections from the book, a vitrine highlighting Granary Press’ special edition of *Silk Poems*, a second vitrine with reference materials and notes about the development of the exhibition, a silk textile produced during Ms Bervin’s Rauschenberg Residency, and four silk textiles from the UMAG collection. The curation of the silk textiles was carried out by UMAG researcher Kikki Lam.
