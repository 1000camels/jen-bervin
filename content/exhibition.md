The first iteration of the *Silk Poems* exhibition at MASS MoCA included three elements—the nanoimprinted poem viewed through a microscope, a draft of the Silk Poems manuscript and Charlotte Lagarde’s film.

When first entering the Fung Ping Shan gallery, visitors were greeted by a projection of bilingual selections from the book and a silkscreened strand of the poem which was made during a Rauschenberg Residency. Due to the HKU campus shut down, the official opening for the exhibition was combined with Ms Bervin’s Poetry Nights reading at the Jao Tsung-I Academy in Kowloon. Over the week of the festival, many of the festival participants took part in guided tours of the exhibition.

The vitrine to the left of the microscope showcases the Granary Books special edition of *Silk Poems*, titled [*7S* (Seven Silks)](https://www.granarybooks.com/book/1195/Jen_Bervin+7S/), a boxed edition of 100 that elaborates upon the research and writings that informed the exhibition.

The vitrine to the right of the microscope contains reference materials developed throughout the artist’s research process and printed fragments from notes she used to draft the poem.

A number of related public events were developed for the exhibition space. One of the most popular was a series of weekend drawing courses led by artist Philippe Charmes. Participants worked from specimens on loan from a collection managed by Dr Benoit Guénard in the HKU School of Biological Sciences.
