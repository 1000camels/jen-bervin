Jen Bervin’s book *Silk Poems* was originally published by [Nightboat](https://nightboat.org/) Books in 2017. The cycle of poems is written from the perspective of a silkworm, exploring the cultural, scientific, and linguistic complexities of silk written inside the human body. A selection of poetry from the book was translated into Chinese for the IPNHK festival in November 2019.

Chinese translation of excerpts from Silk Poems by Shelby Chan.

The Silk Poems exhibition at UMAG was scheduled to coincide with the 10th anniversary of International Poetry Nights in Hong Kong ([IPNHK](http://ipnhk.com/)), an award-winning biennial poetry festival established by contemporary Chinese author Bei Dao. Since its debut in 2009 in Hong Kong, IPNHK has become the most influential series of international poetry events in the sinophone region. Gathering more than 50 world-renowned poets, musicians, translators and scholars, IPNHK 2019 presented an extravaganza of poetry and music events with the theme “Speech and Silence” both in Hong Kong and ten different cities across China.
