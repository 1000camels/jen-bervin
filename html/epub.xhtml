        <p>Silk’s cultural history spans more than 5,000 years. Examples of sericulture appear in the Chinese archaeological record as early as the third millennium BCE, and silk fabrics excavated from sites have been dated to at least the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BCE).</p>
<p>Beyond silk’s traditional use in textiles and as a valuable trade commodity, biomedical researchers are now experimenting with the material in novel forms of technology; since silk is compatible with human tissue, the immune system can accept silk on surfaces as sensitive as the human brain.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.umag.hku.hk/en/exhibition_detail.php?id=1642023">UMAG exhibition <em>Silk Poems</em></a>, visual artist and author Jen Bervin has merged the medium’s traditional applications with cutting edge research—engaging with silk’s cultural, scientific and linguistic complexities.</p>

        <p><em>Silk Poems</em> began as a six-year research project developed with expertise from more than thirty international textile archives, medical libraries, nanotechnology and biomedical labs, and sericulture sites. Jen Bervin first visited the Bioengineering Department at Tufts in 2010, where David Kaplan and Fiorenzo Omenetto were working on a new form of the material—reverse-engineered liquefied silk. Among the research outputs from the Tufts group has been a silk biosensor etched nanoscale on clear silk film that can be implanted in the body to provide diagnostic readings. </p>

  </figcaption></figure>












<p>Using this research as a springboard, Bervin started to write a poem to be inscribed on a silk biosensor. The poem acts as a talisman, written from the perspective of the silkworm, addressed to the person with the biosensor implanted in their body. From this evolved the first few elements of the <em>Silk Poems</em> project—an etched version of the poem viewed through a microscope, Charlotte Lagarde’s short film and a book published by Nightboat Books.</p>
<p>The inaugural display of work related to Bervin’s <em>Silk Poems</em> was as part of a group show at <a href="https://massmoca.org/event/explode-every-day-an-inquiry-into-the-phenomena-of-wonder/?id=1045">MASS MoCA</a> (May 2016–April 2017). The solo exhibition of <em>Silk Poems</em> at <a href="https://www.umag.hku.hk/en/exhibition_detail.php?id=1642023">UMAG</a> (November 2019–February 2020) was scheduled to coincide with the 10th anniversary celebration of the <a href="https://ipnhk.org/">IPNHK</a> literary festival.</p>

        <p>Nanoscale science is concerned with physical interactions at extremely minute dimensions—one nanometer is equal to one-billionth of a meter. A strand of human DNA is 2.5 nanometers in diameter, while a sheet of paper is nearly 75,000 nanometers thick. Nanostructures can be made by reacting chemicals in liquids or gasses, or by etching with electrons. In nature, the iridescent colors of some butterfly wings contain nanostructures that affect light waves.</p>

<p>In 2016, Bervin began working with Tufts’ scientists on fabricating her poetry at nanoscale. In this process, a mask is used to etch the poem in gold spatter onto a silicon wafer, and then liquid silk is poured over the wafer. As the silk dries, the letters remain suspended in the film. The etched version of Bervin’s poem could be viewed at the exhibition’s microscope station.</p>

<p>Bervin’s poem is modeled on silk at the DNA level—the six-character repeat of the silk genome is the basis for the poem’s six-letter line. The shape of the strand reflects both the filament pattern that silkworms create when making their cocoons and the genetic structure of silk, which forms like the weft thread in weaving.</p>

<p>Ongoing research includes scientists dating the genetic split between domestic silkworms and their wild cousins (Bombyx mandarina), as well as a focus on altering the genetic code of silkworms to create fibers from cocoons that can be woven into a material stronger than steel and more flexible than Kevlar. Other recent innovations involve developing materials from silk fibers that are naturally antimicrobial, and the fabrication of silk screws for stabilizing broken bones.</p>

        <p>Sericulture refers to the production of silk fibers through the domesticated farming of silkworms. Chinese legend attributes the origins of sericulture to the wife of the mythical Yellow Emperor, Lady Xiling, around 3000 BCE. Recent archaeological discoveries suggest that silkworms were domesticated in China as early as 3500 BCE.</p>

<p>Silkworm (Bombyx mori) caterpillars feed exclusively on mulberry leaves (Morus) which contain a type of latex toxic to other herbivores. The silk is produced as long fibers excreted as a gel during the larval stage. These fibers create the cocoon that silkworms use when transforming into moths. To collect the silk fibers, farmers unravel the cocoons; when unwound a single cocoon can stretch from 100 to 300 meters long.</p>
<p>Silk as a traditional medium for writing dates back to at least the seventh century BCE, while references in the Confucian Analects and other Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BCE) works suggest an even earlier origin for texts written on silk. Oracle bone script on Shang dynasty (1600-1046 BCE) turtle plastrons and ceremonial bones often include inscriptions for a core group of animals and goods, such as silk, silkworm, book and writing brush. </p>

        <p>Jen Bervin’s book <em>Silk Poems</em> was originally published by <a href="https://nightboat.org/">Nightboat</a> Books in 2017. The cycle of poems is written from the perspective of a silkworm, exploring the cultural, scientific, and linguistic complexities of silk written inside the human body. A selection of poetry from the book was translated into Chinese for the IPNHK festival in November 2019.</p>

<p>The <em>Silk Poems</em> exhibition at UMAG was scheduled to coincide with the 10th anniversary of International Poetry Nights in Hong Kong (<a href="http://ipnhk.com/">IPNHK</a>), an award-winning biennial poetry festival established by contemporary Chinese author Bei Dao. Gathering more than 50 world-renowned poets, musicians, translators and scholars, the IPNHK 2019 festival included poetry readings and lectures and musical performances under the theme of “Speech and Silence.” Events took place in Hong Kong and in ten different cities across China.</p>

        <p>A relatively minimalist show at first glance, the development and installation of the <em>Silk Poems</em> exhibition took the better part of two years. Museum staff were kept busy sourcing the microscope and projectors, converting the opening gallery wall into an exhibition element, choosing silk textiles from UMAG’s permanent collection, translating and subtitling Charlotte Lagarde’s film, creating a movie of bilingual selections from the book <em>Silk Poems</em>, and developing a range of programming for events scheduled around Hong Kong.</p>

        <p>The first iteration of the <em>Silk Poems</em> show at Mass MoCA included three elements—the nanoimprinted poem viewed through a microscope, a copy of the <em>Silk Poems</em> book and Charlotte Lagarde’s film. For the UMAG exhibition, we expanded the show’s initial framework by adding material produced for the Poetry Nights festival, as well as material that was generated while developing the original project with researchers at Tufts University.</p>
<p>When first entering the Fung Ping Shan gallery, visitors were greeted by a projection of bilingual selections from the book and a silkscreened strand of the poem which was made during a Rauschenberg Residency. Due to the HKU campus shut down, the official opening for the exhibition was combined with Ms Bervin’s Poetry Nights reading at the Jao Tsung-I Academy in Kowloon. Over the week of the festival, many of the festival participants took part in guided tours of the exhibition.</p>

<h4 id="jen-bervinhttpjenbervincom-contributors"><a href="http://jenbervin.com/">Jen Bervin</a></h4>
<p>Created in collaboration with artists and specialists ranging from material scientists to literary scholars, Bervin’s intricate, intimate, often laborious work ranges in scale from poems written nanoscale in liquefied silk to large-scale museum installations. Her multidisciplinary, research-driven practice activates the intersections of text and textiles, art, poetry, and scholarship, science, technology and craft.</p>
<p>Bervin’s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at The University of Hong Kong, Des Moines Art Center, and Brown University; an upcoming survey exhibition of her interdisciplinary work at University Galleries of Illinois State University is supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Bervin’s work has been featured at the Walker Art Center, MASS MoCA, John Michael Kohler Art Center, Center for Craft, Creativity and Design, The Power Plant, Toronto, Ian Potter Museum of Art, Melbourne, and can be found in thirty international collections including The J. Paul Getty Museum.</p>
